This repository contains code for the "Find the Longest Consecutive Character" question. 
You're given a string and your job is to write a function that takes the string and finds
the longest subsequence of a single character within the string.

The return format of the function should be an object that contains the letter and the 
number of times it occurs. 

```
{[
    letter: 'B',
    count: 3
]}
```
