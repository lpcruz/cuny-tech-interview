# cuny-tech-interview


This repository contains code for the "Build a reminder notification" question. 
You've got a TODO list but you really don't want to do those things. So you click 
a button that says `Remind me after 3 days`. For some reason, 3 days is right?

Design a way such that an alert or confirmation is made on the page 
that it's time to do those TODO items

Submit your solution as a pull request for review.
